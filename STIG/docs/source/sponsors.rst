The California Energy Systems for the 21st Century (CES-21) program funded by the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) created many capabilities to meet the connected nature of the electric grid for the State of California.  The CPUC funded development on STIG version 1 has granted permission to release STIG to the open source community to promote potential uses beyond CES-21.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) *Improving the Quality and Resilience of Critical Computing Infrastructure* project funded the development of STIG version 2.0.0, which included an upgrade from STIX version 2.0 to version 2.1 as well as many of the bug fixes and UI enhancements.
